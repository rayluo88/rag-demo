Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant external knowledge during the generation process. This approach combines the power of retrieval-based systems with generative AI.

Key Components of RAG:
1. Knowledge Base: A collection of documents or information stored in a vector database.
2. Embeddings: Vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning.
3. Retriever: A system that finds relevant information from the knowledge base.
4. Generator: An LLM that produces responses using the retrieved context.

Benefits of RAG:
- Improved accuracy by grounding responses in specific knowledge
- Reduced hallucination compared to pure LLM responses
- Ability to work with up-to-date or domain-specific information
- More controllable and transparent generation process

Common Use Cases:
- Question answering systems
- Customer support chatbots
- Documentation search and summarization
- Knowledge base exploration
